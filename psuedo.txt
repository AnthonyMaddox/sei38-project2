initial game logic:
resetGame
// two player game
// deck has 52 cards
// deck is shuffled and each player recieves half of the deck (26 unknown random cards)

playRound
// players play at the same time revealing their top card of their deck in the pot

compareCards, playerWinsRound
// winner with the highest value card takes all cards in the pot and they are returned face down at the bottom of their deck
// if both card values ==, than it's war
// if war, each player puts one another card from their deck into the pot facedown and then plays another round

isWar
// if new card values again equal each other, it's war. Else highest value card wins
//  once a player cannot play anymore cards during a round, that player loses and the other player wins the game

playerWinsGame
// after a player wins game, score is logged, game resets with deck shuffled and new decks dealt to each player
